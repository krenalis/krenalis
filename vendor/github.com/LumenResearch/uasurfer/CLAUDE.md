# uasurfer

Parses HTTP User-Agent strings into a `UserAgent` (browser, OS, device type).
The philosophy is to identify technologies holding >1% market share and to spend
neither cycles nor accuracy guessing at esoteric agents.

## Goals, in priority order

1. **Correct** — a wrong classification is worse than an unknown one.
2. **Fast** — this runs per request in ad-serving hot paths. Substring scans over
   the agent are the cost; the parser is judged in nanoseconds per parse.
3. **Consistent** — one name per concept, one verb per kind of operation.
4. **Concise** — prefer deleting to adding. The shortest version that stays clear.
5. **Stable** — the exported API is depended on downstream. See below.

## Public API is frozen

Exported names, their signatures and their semantics do not change without an
explicit decision. Constants are append-only and must keep their values: callers
persist them as ints. Internal naming, file layout and implementation are free to
change.

The bot constants must stay a contiguous block at the **end** of the
`BrowserName` list: `IsBot` is a range check from `BrowserBot` to the terminator,
so a non-bot appended after them silently becomes a bot.
`TestBrowserNameStrings` pins the last one by name and fails if that happens.

## Naming

Three names for three concepts, used everywhere:

| name | meaning |
|---|---|
| `ua` | the whole normalised (lowercased) agent |
| `agentPlatform` | the text inside the first parentheses |
| `specs` | the first `;`-delimited field of `agentPlatform` |

Verb prefixes:

- `parse*` — reads the agent (or a slice of it) and **sets fields on the
  receiver**: `parseOS`, `parseDevice`, `parseiOSVersion`, `Version.parseAfter`.
  Anything that mutates while reading the agent belongs here.
- `is*` — pure predicate, no mutation: `isTV`, `isAmazonFire`, `isiPad`.
- Anything else returns a value and names what it returns: `landscape`,
  `darwinToIOS`, `normalise`, `copyLower`.

Do not use `get*` for something that mutates, or `eval*` as a synonym for parse.
`applyBotDefaults` is deliberately outside the `parse*` family: it reads
already-parsed fields rather than the agent.

## Receivers

Every type here is a handful of ints, cheap to copy. So:

- **A pointer receiver means the method mutates.** `parse*`, `Reset`,
  `applyBotDefaults`.
- **Everything else takes a value receiver**, `is*` predicates included:
  `ScreenSize.isiPad`, `ScreenSize.landscape`, `Version.Less`, the `String`
  methods. Do not reach for a pointer just to avoid a copy at this size, and do
  not use one so a method can absorb a nil check — handle nil at the call site,
  as `parseMacintosh` and `parseAppleNative` do for `hints.ScreenSize`.

`UserAgent.IsBot` is the one exception: it does not mutate but keeps its pointer
receiver because it is exported and the API is frozen.

## Bot markers

`botMarkers` in `bot.go` is deliberately not a list of crawler names: the generic
tokens (`bot` as a word, `spider`, `crawl`, `+http`) carry most of the recall, and
a name is listed only when it is reported through its own constant or is too
quiet to carry a generic token.

A marker must be one **no real device can carry**. This is the whole discipline
of the file, and it is easy to get wrong: `java/` looks like a server-side stack
and is what J2ME feature phones announce; `whatsapp/` is the messenger as often
as the link fetcher; `dalvik`, `cfnetwork` and `okhttp` carry real ad requests
from real apps. `bot` needs its word check or the phone brand CUBOT matches.

A marker that must be found in a browser-shaped agent also has to trip
`botSuspect`, the cheap gate deciding who pays for the full scan; otherwise it is
only ever reached through `parseBrowserName`'s default arm.

## Performance

- **Avoid allocating where you reasonably can.** A parse currently costs one
  allocation, the lowercased copy in `normalise`. That is a target to beat, not a
  hard cap: add an allocation when it genuinely buys correctness or clarity, but
  know that you are adding it and say why. Watch the count with `-benchmem` so a
  change never moves it by accident.
- Nothing may cause the agent string to escape to the heap. `regexp` does — that
  is why `isAmazonFire` is hand rolled. Verify with `go build -gcflags='-m'`.
- Long `strings.Contains` chains over the whole agent are O(markers × len). When
  a list grows past a handful, bucket by first byte and scan once, as `isTV`
  does.
- Benchmark before and after any hot-path change with `make benchstat`, which
  measures master and the working tree and compares them with benchstat. Report
  what it says, including regressions. A percentage is not automatically a
  blocker: a parse is a few hundred nanoseconds, and buying accuracy with some of
  that budget is a legitimate trade - saying so out loud is the requirement.
- `make benchguard` is the gate CI runs, on a pull request, measuring the base
  commit and the change on the same runner. It fails a benchmark only when it is
  slower by **both** a third and a few hundred nanoseconds, and fails any increase
  in allocations outright. Needing both keeps a 15ns check growing to 85ns from
  failing a parse that still costs half a microsecond, while catching the change
  of shape - a compiled regexp, a scan gone quadratic. Do not chase percentages
  below that bar; do explain the ones above it.

## Tests

- **New non-trivial code ships with a test.** A branch, a loop, a table, a
  parser, a boundary rule: if it can be wrong, something has to fail when it is.
  Trivial one-liners and pure renames do not need one. This is not negotiable
  per-change — it is the reason a twenty year old parser can still be refactored
  at all.
- A test lives in the `_test.go` file mirroring the implementation file it
  covers. `device.go` → `device_test.go`. Never create catch-all test files. Two
  deliberate exceptions: **benchmarks** all live in `bench_test.go`, because the
  parse path is one budget and comparing a change means running the whole set,
  and a **helper used by more than one test file** lives in `uasurfer_test.go`
  rather than beside its first caller.
- Test the exported API. Reach for a private function only when it is
  package-level, non-trivial, and not already covered through `Parse` —
  `isFireTV` and `botName` earn a test, the byte predicates they call do not.
  Testing a marker table entry by entry is noise; testing the behaviour the table
  exists for is not.
- Non-trivial logic leaves a runnable check behind. When hand rolling a
  replacement for something standard, keep the original as a test oracle and
  compare differentially — see `TestIsAmazonFire` against the regexp it replaced.
- When correctness depends on an invariant, assert the invariant, not just the
  behaviour: `TestIPadScreenSizesAreLandscape` guards the table ordering that
  `isiPad` relies on, and `TestBotMarkersAreIndexed` guards the index `botName`
  reads, where a mis-bucketed marker is simply never tried.
- Anything that walks untrusted input by index belongs in `FuzzParse`'s
  properties rather than in another table of hand-picked strings. CI fuzzes for a
  minute per run; a crash found there is written to `testdata/fuzz` and becomes a
  permanent seed.

### Fixtures

Fixture sets of real agents live in `testdata/` and are documented in
[doc/fixtures.md](doc/fixtures.md). Two rules matter when touching them:

- A row is a claim about what an agent *means*, not a snapshot of current output.
  When a change makes one fail, work out which of the two is wrong first. Test
  suites that were regenerated to match a bug are how parsers rot.
- Sources must be permissively licensed (MIT, BSD, Apache-2.0) and credited in
  `testdata/NOTICE.md`. Take agent strings, never another parser's labels: those
  are its judgement in its categories, and copying them imports both.
- `botRecallFloor` in `bot_test.go` is the share of the bot fixture set detected.
  Raise it when detection improves; lowering it to make a change pass is how a
  detector rots.

### Checking against other parsers

Accuracy has been measured against the open-source parsers whose licences allow
it - [yauaa](https://github.com/nielsbasjes/yauaa) (Apache-2.0),
[bowser](https://github.com/bowser-js/bowser) and
[isbot](https://github.com/omrilotan/isbot) (MIT) - over the top million agents
of real traffic: **99.998% agreement on bots, 99.83% on OS, 99.07% on device
type**, and 100/100/99.8 on the five thousand most frequent.

Worth knowing before reading anything into a future run:

- **Prefer a permissively licensed reference, and avoid copyleft where there is a
  reasonable alternative.** The parsers named above were picked on merit as much
  as licence, which is the happy case. A copyleft project (AGPL, LGPL, GPL) is not
  ruled out: if one is genuinely the better benchmark for a field, it is worth
  considering, and worth saying in the report why it was chosen.
- **Whichever way that goes, avoiding a licence conflict is the first priority,
  ahead of the measurement itself.** With a copyleft reference that means: run it,
  read its **output**, and nothing else. Not its source, not its regexes, pattern
  files, fixture labels or test data, and nothing paraphrased from them. None of it
  is committed here in any form, and it is not named as a source of anything we
  ship. A change its output prompts is derived from the agent strings and from what
  the vendor calls its own product, never from how that project chose to match
  them. If a step is even arguably a violation, do not take it: no number is worth
  a licensing question.
- Nothing of any reference is committed, permissive ones included. Their agent
  strings may be, with the credit in `testdata/NOTICE.md`; their labels may not,
  because a label is that project's judgement in that project's categories.
- **Disagreement is not error.** The large clusters where we differ are Fire TV
  sticks, operator set-top boxes and Apple TV, where the others are wrong and we
  are not. The cluster where we are wrong is opaque Android tablet model codes
  (`23073RPBFG`), which needs the thousand-model table this library declines to
  ship. Before "fixing" a disagreement, work out which side is right - the same
  rule as for a fixture row.
- Deliberate differences, not gaps: `okhttp` is an app HTTP stack rather than a
  crawler, and Fire devices report `OSKindle` because Fire OS is what they run.

### Enum terminators

Each `iota` block ends in an unexported terminator (`_deviceTypeFinal` and
friends). Because it shifts whenever a constant is added, tests can enumerate the
lists at runtime — which Go constants otherwise do not allow. Keep it last.

This is why there is no `stringer`: `String()` methods are hand written as
explicit switches next to their constants. Adding a constant means adding its
`case` — nothing else, as the tests do not pin the exact names.

`assertNames` checks that the names are **unique** and carry the type's prefix,
not that they match a golden list. Uniqueness is what makes that sufficient:
`String()` has no numeric fallback, so a constant with no `case` falls into the
default arm and repeats the Unknown name, and the duplicate gives it away. The
same check catches two cases returning the same name by copy-paste.

## Documentation

`README.md` stays short: what the package is, the API, the honest caveats, and
links out. Lists and special topics live in `doc/<topic>.md` — bot detection,
connected TV, in-app browsers, client hints. Constant lists are not duplicated
anywhere: they link to pkg.go.dev. A new constant goes in the relevant
`doc/` file, not the README.

## Tooling

Everything below must be clean before work is considered done:

```sh
make all   # go fix, goimports, vet, golangci-lint, tests
```

Which is:

```sh
go fix ./...              # Go 1.26 modernizers, run as standard
goimports -l .            # not gofmt: it also fixes the imports an edit moved
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run ./...   # CI runs this; it fails the build
go test ./...
```

## Workflow

- Do not weaken a test to make it pass.
